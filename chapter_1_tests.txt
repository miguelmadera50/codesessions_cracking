// Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use
// additional data structures?
Positive - assuming only 26 chars

Positive - assuming only 26 chars

1.3
// URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has
// sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the 'true' length of
// the string.
Assuming asterisks as nulls/extrachar. Only using 26 chars
"a b**" -> "a%20b"
"a b ****" -> "a%20b%20"

"www google a com search **********" -> "www%20google%20a%20com%20search%20"


1.4
// Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if is a permutation of a palindrome. A
// palindrome is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary
// words.

1.5
// One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a
// character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or
// zero edits) away.

1.6
// String Compression: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated
// characters. For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3". If the compressed string would not
// become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the
// string has only uppercase and lowercase letters.

1.7
// Rotate Matrix: Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a
// method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in-place?

1.9
// String Rotation: Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another.
// Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to ch3eck if s2 is a rotation of s1 by using only one call to
// isSubstring (e.g., "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat").
